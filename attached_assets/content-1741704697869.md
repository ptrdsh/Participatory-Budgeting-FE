# CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION

[Permalink: CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#cardano-blockchain-ecosystem-constitution)

## PREAMBLE

[Permalink: PREAMBLE](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#preamble)

Cardano is a decentralized ecosystem of blockchain technology, smart contracts,
and community governance, committed to improving economic, political, and
social systems for everyone, everywhere.
By offering this foundational infrastructure, Cardano empowers individuals and
communities to manage their identity, value and governance, fostering the
emergence of decentralized applications, businesses and network states.

Through unbiased processing of immutable data, we, the participants of the
Cardano Community, consisting of individuals, organizations, contributors and
others, choose to follow in the footsteps of the early Internet and
cryptocurrency pioneers, who first forged bonds of community through digital
technologies.
We are guided by our shared principles and tenets as we exercise our
self-governance by balancing decentralized decision-making with accountability
and safeguarding the security of the Cardano Blockchain.

Recognizing the need for a more robust and dynamic governance framework, that
neither relies nor depends upon traditional nation-state governance systems,
but instead relies on self-governance by the Cardano Community, utilizing,
wherever possible and beneficial, blockchain technology in the governance
process, we hereby establish this Cardano Constitution to govern the Cardano
Blockchain ecosystem, ensure the continuity of the Cardano Blockchain, and
guard the rights of those who utilize it.

With these purposes in mind, we, the Cardano Community, affirm our intention to
abide by this Constitution in order to participate in the governance of the
Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.
We invite all who share our values to join us but stand not in the way of any
who wish to take another path.

[Permalink: ARTICLE VII. CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITTEE](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#article-vii-constitutional-committee)

### Section 1

[Permalink: Section 1](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#section-1-6)

A Constitutional Committee shall be established as the branch of Cardano's
on-chain governance process that ensures governance actions to be enacted
on-chain are consistent with this Constitution.
The Constitutional Committee shall comprise a set of owners of ada that is
collectively responsible for ensuring that on-chain governance actions prior to
enactment on-chain, are constitutional.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 4 of this Article VII, the
Constitutional Committee shall be limited to voting on the constitutionality of
governance actions to be enacted on-chain.
Constitutional Committee members are expected to have appropriate expertise to
carry out their required responsibilities, considering their past contributions
and involvement in the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.

### Section 2

[Permalink: Section 2](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#section-2-6)

The Constitutional Committee shall be composed of such number of members
sufficient to assure the ongoing integrity of the Cardano Blockchain as
determined from time to time by owners of ada.
The minimum and maximum number of members of the Constitutional Committee shall
be consistent with the minimum and maximum number of members as set forth in
the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix.

Members of the Constitutional Committee shall serve such term lengths as shall
be determined from time to time by owners of ada as consistent with the minimum
and maximum term lengths as set forth in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails
Appendix.
To assure continuity in the operation of the Constitutional Committee, the
terms for Constitutional Committee members shall be staggered.

### Section 3

[Permalink: Section 3](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#section-3-5)

The Cardano Community shall establish and make public a process from time to
time for election of members of the Constitutional Committee consistent with
the requirements of the Guardrails.

### Section 4

[Permalink: Section 4](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#section-4-5)

No governance action, other than a "Motion of no confidence," or "Update
Constitutional Committee/threshold and/or term" may be implemented on-chain
unless a requisite percentage of the members of the Constitutional Committee as
specified by the Guardrails shall have first determined and affirmed through an
on-chain action that such proposal does not violate this Constitution.
Each Constitutional Committee member shall have one vote.

Because "Info" actions have no on-chain effect and, accordingly, are neither
constitutional nor unconstitutional, Constitutional Committee members may not
prevent "Info" actions from being recorded on-chain.
Members of the Constitutional Committee may nevertheless record a vote on-chain
regarding an "Info" action in order to express their view on such "Info"
action, including whether the suggested course of action proposed in such
"Info" action, would be, in the view of such member, unconstitutional if it
were to be enforced by on-chain mechanisms.

In the case of "Info" actions that propose a Cardano Blockchain ecosystem
budget, Constitutional Committee members shall record a vote on-chain that sets
forth their opinion as to whether the proposed budget, if it were to be
implemented in the form contained in the "Info" action, would violate this
Constitution.

In the case of "Info" actions that propose a withdrawal from the Cardano
Blockchain treasury pursuant to a previously approved budget, Constitutional
Committee members shall record a vote on-chain that sets forth their opinion as
to whether such proposed withdrawal, if made in accordance with such "Info"
action, would violate this Constitution.

### Section 5

[Permalink: Section 5](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#section-5-3)

The Constitutional Committee shall be considered to be in one of the following
two states at all times: a state of confidence or a state of no-confidence.
In a state of no-confidence, members of the then standing Constitutional
Committee must be reinstated or replaced using the "Update committee/threshold"
governance action before any other on-chain governance action, other than
"Info" actions, may go forward.
During a state of no-confidence, "Info" actions other than "Info" actions
relating to budget proposals or treasury withdrawal proposals, may continue to
be recorded on-chain.

If a member of the Constitutional Committee is not carrying out its
responsibilities as required by this Constitution, as so determined by a
requisite percentage as specified by the Guardrails of SPOs and DReps, voting
separately pursuant to an "Update Constitutional Committee/threshold and/or
term" governance action, such member shall be removed from the Constitutional
Committee upon the implementation of the governance action.
Thereafter, an election shall be held as soon as practical to replace the
member so removed.

In the event of a "Motion of no confidence" governance action to remove all
members of the Constitutional Committee at the same time, that is approved by a
requisite percentage as specified by the Guardrails of DReps and SPOs, upon
implementation of the governance action, the Constitutional Committee shall be
considered to be a state of no-confidence until such time as an election has
been held either to reinstate the existing Constitutional Committee members in
whole or in part, or to elect new Constitutional Committee members.

### Section 6

[Permalink: Section 6](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#section-6-2)

Constitutional Committee processes shall be transparent.
The Constitutional Committee shall publish each decision.
When voting that a governance action proposed to be executed on-chain is
unconstitutional, the Constitutional Committee collectively, or each member of
the Constitutional Committee casting such a vote separately, shall set forth the
basis for its decision with reference to specific Articles of this Constitution
or provisions of the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix that are in
conflict with a given proposal.
Internal deliberations among members of the Constitutional Committee, prior to
casting votes, are not required to be publicly disclosed.

The Constitutional Committee shall operate pursuant to a code of conduct
periodically adopted and published by the Constitutional Committee.
The Constitutional Committee is encouraged to include ethical guidelines in its
code of conduct.
The Constitutional Committee shall periodically adopt and publish such policies
and procedures as the Constitutional Committee shall deem necessary in carrying
out its duties.

### Section 7

## APPENDIX I: CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN GUARDRAILS

[Permalink: APPENDIX I: CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN GUARDRAILS](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#appendix-i-cardano-blockchain-guardrails)

### 1\. Introduction

[Permalink: 1. Introduction](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#1-introduction)

To implement Cardano Blockchain on-chain governance, it is necessary to
establish sensible Guardrails that will enable the Cardano Blockchain to
continue to operate in a secure and sustainable way.

This Appendix sets forth Guardrails that must be applied to Cardano Blockchain
on-chain governance actions, including changes to the protocol parameters and
limits on treasury withdrawals.
These Guardrails cover both essential, intrinsic limits on settings, and
recommendations that are based on experience, measurement and governance
objectives.

These Guardrails are designed to avoid unexpected problems with the operation
of the Cardano Blockchain.
They are intended to guide the choice of sensible parameter settings and avoid
potential problems with security, performance, functionality or long-term
sustainability.
As described below, some of these Guardrails are automatable and will be
enforced via an on-chain Guardrails Script or built-in ledger rules.

These Guardrails apply only to the Cardano Blockchain Layer 1 mainnet
environment.
They are not intended to apply to test environments or to other blockchains
that use Cardano Blockchain software.

Not all parameters for the Cardano Blockchain can be considered independently.
Some parameters interact with other settings in an intrinsic way.
Where known, these interactions are addressed in this Appendix.

While the Guardrails in this Appendix presently reflect the current state of
technical insight, this Appendix should be treated as a living document.
Implementation improvements, new simulations or performance evaluation results
for the Cardano Blockchain may allow some of the restrictions contained in
these Guardrails to be relaxed (or, in some circumstances, require them to be
tightened) in due course.

Additional Guardrails may also be needed where, for example, new protocol
parameters are introduced.

#### Amending, Adding or Deprecating Guardrails

[Permalink: Amending, Adding or Deprecating Guardrails](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#amending-adding-or-deprecating-guardrails)

The Guardrails set forth in this Appendix may be amended from time to time
pursuant to an on-chain governance action that satisfies the applicable voting
threshold as set forth in this Appendix.
Any such amendment to any Guardrails shall require and be deemed to be an
amendment to the Constitution itself, including any new Guardrails.
Each Guardrail has a unique label.
If the text of a Guardrail is amended, the existing Guardrail will be
deprecated and a new label will be used in this Appendix.
Similarly, if a Guardrail is completely deprecated, its label will never be
reused in the future.
In all cases, the Guardrails that apply to a governance action will be those in
force at the time that the governance action is submitted on chain, regardless
of any later amendments.

#### Terminology and Guidance

[Permalink: Terminology and Guidance](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#terminology-and-guidance)

**Should/Should not.** Where this Appendix says that a value "should not" be
set below or above some value, this means that the Guardrail is a
recommendation or guideline, and the specific value could be open to discussion
or alteration by a suitably expert group recognized by the Cardano Community in
light of experience with the Cardano Blockchain governance system or the
operation of the Cardano Blockchain.

**Must/Must not.** Where this Appendix says that a value "must" or "must not"
be set below or above some value, this means that the Guardrail is a requirement
that will be enforced by Cardano Blockchain ledger rules, types or other
built-in mechanisms where possible, and that if not followed could cause a
protocol failure, security breach or other undesirable outcome.

**Benchmarking.** Benchmarking refers to careful system level performance
evaluation that is designed to show _a priori_ that, for example, 95% of blocks
will be diffused across a global network of Cardano Blockchain nodes within the
required 5s time interval in all cases.
This may require construction of specific test workflows and execution on a
large test network of Cardano Blockchain nodes, simulating a global Cardano
Blockchain network.

**Performance analysis.** Performance analysis refers to projecting theoretical
performance, empirical benchmarking or simulation results to predict actual
system behavior.
For example, performance results obtained from tests in a controlled test
environment (such as a collection of data centers with known networking
properties) may be extrapolated to inform likely performance behavior in a real
Cardano Blockchain network environment.

**Simulation.** Simulation refers to synthetic execution that is designed to
inform performance/functionality decisions in a repeatable way.
For example, the IOSim Cardano Blockchain module allows the operation of the
networking stack to be simulated in a controlled and repeatable way, allowing
issues to be detected before code deployment.

**Performance Monitoring.** Performance monitoring involves measuring the
actual behavior of the Cardano Blockchain network, for example, by using timing
probes to evaluate round-trip times, or test blocks to assess overall network
health.
It complements benchmarking and performance analysis by providing information
about actual system behavior that cannot be obtained using simulated workloads
or theoretical analysis.

**Reverting Changes.** Where performance monitoring shows that actual network
behavior following a change is inconsistent with the performance requirements
for the Cardano Blockchain, then the change must be reverted to its previous
state if that is possible.
For example, if the block size is increased from 100KB to 120KB and 95% of
blocks are no longer diffused within 5s, then a change must be made to revert
the block size to 100KB.
If this is not possible, then one or more alternative changes must be made that
will ensure that the performance requirements are met.

**Severity Levels.** Issues that affect the Cardano Blockchain network are
classified by severity level, where:

- Severity 1 is a critical incident or issue with very high impact to the
security, performance, functionality or long-term sustainability of the Cardano
Blockchain network

- Severity 2 is a major incident or issue with significant impact to the
security, performance, functionality or long-term sustainability of the Cardano
Blockchain network

- Severity 3 is a minor incident or issue with low impact to the security,
performance, functionality or long-term sustainability of the Cardano
Blockchain network


**Future Performance Requirements.** Planned development such as new mechanisms
for out of memory storage may impact block diffusion or other times.
When changing parameters, it is necessary to consider these future performance
requirements as well as the current operation of the Cardano Blockchain.
Until development is complete, the requirements will be conservative but may
then be relaxed to account for actual timing behavior.

#### Automated Checking ("Guardrails Script")

[Permalink: Automated Checking ("Guardrails Script")](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#automated-checking-guardrails-script)

A script hash is associated with the Constitution hash when a
**New Constitution or Guardrails Script** governance action is enacted.
It acts as an additional safeguard to the ledger rules and types, filtering
non-compliant governance actions.

The Guardrails Script only affects two types of governance actions:

- **Parameter Update** actions, and

- **Treasury Withdrawal** actions.


The Guardrails Script is executed when either of these types of governance
action is submitted on-chain.
This avoids scenarios where, for example, an erroneous script could prevent the
Cardano Blockchain from ever enacting a Hard Fork action, resulting in deadlock.
There are three different situations that apply to Guardrail Script usage.

**Symbol and Explanation**

- (y) The Guardrail Script can be used to enforce the Guardrail
- (x) The Guardrail Script cannot be used to enforce the Guardrail
- (~ \- reason) The Guardrail Script cannot be used to enforce the Guardrail for
the reason given, but future ledger changes could enable this.

Guardrails may overlap: in this case, the most restrictive set of Guardrails
will apply.

Where a parameter is not explicitly listed in this document, then the Guardrail
Script **must not** permit any changes to the parameter.

Conversely, where a parameter is explicitly listed in this document but no
checkable Guardrails are specified, the Guardrail Script **must not** impose
any constraints on changes to the parameter.

### 2\. Guardrails and Guidelines on Protocol Parameter Update Actions

[Permalink: 2. Guardrails and Guidelines on Protocol Parameter Update Actions](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#2-guardrails-and-guidelines-on-protocol-parameter-update-actions)

Below are Guardrails and guidelines for changing updatable protocol parameter
settings via the protocol parameter update governance action such that the
Cardano Blockchain is never in an unrecoverable state as a result of such
changes.

Note that, to avoid ambiguity, this Appendix uses the parameter name that is
used in protocol parameter update governance actions rather than any other
convention.

[Permalink: GUARDRAILS](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#guardrails-1)

PARAM-03a (y) Critical protocol parameters require an SPO vote in addition to a
DRep vote: SPOs **must** say "yes" with a collective support of more than 50%
of all active block production stake.
This is enforced by the Guardrails on the stake pool voting threshold.

PARAM-04a (x) At least 3 months **should** normally pass between the
publication of an off-chain proposal to change a critical protocol parameter
and the submission of the corresponding on-chain governance action.
This Guardrail may be relaxed in the event of a Severity 1 or Severity 2
network issue following careful technical discussion and evaluation.

50% of all active voting stake.
This is enforced by the Guardrails on the DRep voting thresholds.

PARAM-06a (x) At least 3 months **should** normally pass between the
publication of an off-chain proposal to change a parameter that is critical to
the governance system and the submission of the corresponding on-chain
governance action.

network issue following careful technical discussion and evaluation.

### 2.2. Economic Parameters

[Permalink: 2.2. Economic Parameters](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#22-economic-parameters)

The overall goals when managing economic parameters are to:

1. Enable long-term economic sustainability for the Cardano Blockchain;

2. Ensure that stake pools are adequately rewarded for maintaining the
Cardano Blockchain;

3. Ensure that ada owners are adequately rewarded for using stake in
constructive ways, including when delegating ada for block production; and

4. Balance economic incentives for different Cardano Blockchain ecosystem
stakeholders, including but not limited to Stake Pool Operators, ada owners,
DeFi users, infrastructure users, developers (e.g. DApps) and financial
intermediaries (e.g. exchanges)


#### Triggers for Change

[Permalink: Triggers for Change](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#triggers-for-change)

1. Significant changes in the fiat value of ada resulting in potential problems
with security, performance, functionality or long-term sustainability

2. Changes in transaction volumes or types

3. Community requests or suggestions

4. Emergency situations that require changes to economic parameters


#### Counter-indicators

[Permalink: Counter-indicators](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#counter-indicators)

Changes to the economic parameters should not be made in isolation.
They need to account for:

- External economic factors

- Network security concerns


#### Core Metrics

[Permalink: Core Metrics](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#core-metrics)

- Fiat value of ada resulting in potential problems with security, performance,
functionality or long-term sustainability

- Transaction volumes and types

- Number and health of stake pools

- External economic factors


#### Changes to Specific Economic Parameters

[Permalink: Changes to Specific Economic Parameters](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#changes-to-specific-economic-parameters)

Transaction fee per byte (txFeePerByte) and fixed transaction fee (txFeeFixed)

Defines the cost for basic transactions in lovelace:

_fee(tx) = txFeeFixed + txFeePerByte x nBytes(tx)_

##### GUARDRAILS

TFPB-01 (y) _txFeePerByte_ **must not** be lower than 30 (0.000030 ada) This
protects against low-cost denial of service attacks

TFPB-02 (y) _txFeePerByte_ **must not** exceed 1,000 (0.001 ada) This ensures
that transactions can be paid for

TFPB-03 (y) _txFeePerByte_ **must not** be negative

TFF-01 (y) _txFeeFixed_ **must not** be lower than 100,000 (0.1 ada) This
protects against low-cost denial of service attacks

TFF-02 (y) _txFeeFixed_ **must not** exceed 10,000,000 (10 ada) This ensures
that transactions can be paid for

TFF-03 (y) _txFeeFixed_ **must not** be negative

TFGEN-01 (x - "should") To maintain a consistent level of protection agains
denial-of-service attacks, _txFeeFixed_ and _txFeeFixed_ **should** be adjusted
whenever Plutus Execution prices are adjusted
(executionUnitPrices\[steps/memory\])

TFGEN-02 (x - unquantifiable) Any changes to _txFeeFixed_ or _txFeeFixed_ **must** consider the implications of reducing the cost of a denial-of-service
attack or increasing the maximum transaction fee so that it becomes impossible
to construct a transaction.

#### UTxO cost per byte (utxoCostPerByte)

[Permalink: UTxO cost per byte (utxoCostPerByte)](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#utxo-cost-per-byte-utxocostperbyte)

Defines the deposit (in lovelace) that is charged for each byte of storage tha
is held in a UTxO.
This deposit is returned when the UTxO is no longer active.

- Sets a minimum threshold on ada that is held within a single UTxO

- Provides protection against low-cost denial of service attack on UTxO storage.
DoS protection decreases in line with the free node memory (proportional to
UTxO growth)

- Helps reduce long-term storage costs for node users by providing an incentive
to return UTxOs when no longer needed, or to merge UTxOs.

UCPB-05a (x - "should") Changes **should** account for

1. The acceptable cost of attack

2. The acceptable time for an attack

3. The acceptable memory configuration for full node users

4. The sizes of UTxOs and

5. The current total node memory usage


#### Stake address deposit (stakeAddressDeposit)

[Permalink: Stake address deposit (stakeAddressDeposit)](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#stake-address-deposit-stakeaddressdeposit)

Ensures that stake addresses are retired when no longer needed

- Helps reduce long-term storage costs

- Helps limit CPU and memory costs in the ledger


The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources
are returned when they are no longer required.
Reducing the number of active stake addresses also reduces processing and
memory costs at the epoch boundary when calculating stake snapshots.

Ensures that stake pools are retired by the stake pool operator when no longer
needed by them

- Helps reduce long-term storage costs

The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources
are returned when they are no longer required.
Rewards and stake snapshot calculations are also impacted by the number of
active stake pools.

to:

1. Match the available Cardano Blockchain Layer 1 network capacity to current or
future traffic demands, including payment transactions, layer 1 DApps,
sidechain management and governance needs

2. Balance traffic demands for different user groups, including payment
transactions, minters of Fungible/Non-Fungible Tokens, Plutus scripts, DeFi
developers, Stake Pool Operators and voting transactions

- Traffic volume (block size over time)

- Script volume (size of scripts and execution units)

- Script execution cost benchmarks

- Block propagation delay/diffusion benchmarks


Detailed benchmarking results are required to confirm the effect of any changes
on mainnet performance or behavior prior to enactment.
The effects of different transaction mixes must be analyzed, including normal
transactions, Plutus scripts, and governance actions.

All network parameter changes **must be** monitored carefully for no less than
2 epochs (10 days)

- Changes **must** be reverted as soon as possible if block propagation
delays exceed 4.5s for more than 5% of blocks over any 6 hour rolling window

All other parameter changes should be monitored

- The reversion plan **should** be implemented if the overall effect on
performance, security, functionality or long-term sustainability is
unacceptable.

A specific reversion/recovery plan **must be** produced for each parameter
change.
This plan must include:

- Which parameters need to change and in which ways in order to return to the
previous state (or a similar state)

- How to recover the network in the event of disastrous failure


This plan **should** be followed if problems are observed following the
parameter change.
Note that not all changes can be reverted.
Additional care must be taken when making changes to these parameters.

### 2.7. Non-Updatable Protocol Parameters

Some fundamental protocol parameters cannot be changed by the Protocol
Parameter Update governance action.
These parameters can only be changed in a new Genesis file as part of a hard
fork.
It is not necessary to provide specific guardrails on updating these parameters.

### 4\. Guardrails and Guidelines on Hard Fork Initiation Actions

[Permalink: 4. Guardrails and Guidelines on Hard Fork Initiation Actions](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#4-guardrails-and-guidelines-on-hard-fork-initiation-actions)

The **hard fork initiation** action requires both a new major and a new minor
protocol version to be specified.

- As positive integers

As the result of a hard fork, new updatable protocol parameters may be
introduced.
Guardrails may be defined for these parameters, which will take effect
following the hard fork.
Existing updatable protocol parameters may also be deprecated by the hard fork,
in which case the guardrails become obsolete for all future changes.

[Permalink: APPENDIX II: SUPPORTING GUIDANCE](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#appendix-ii-supporting-guidance)

This Appendix II is intended to provide guidance in interpreting the
Constitution and the Constitutional Committee shall consider this Appendix II
as it deems relevant and useful in carrying out its constitutional duties.

### 1\. Framing Notes

[Permalink: 1. Framing Notes](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#1-framing-notes)

The Cardano Blockchain was established in 2017.
In July 2020 the Cardano Blockchain was expanded to include independent block
validators and in September 2024 an on-chain governance system was introduced.
This Constitution outlines the rights and responsibilities of governance actors
in the decentralized system who represent the owners of ada, the governance
token of the Cardano Blockchain.
The Cardano Blockchain is presently a decentralized ecosystem of blockchain
technology, smart contracts, and community governance.

In approaching this Constitution, the Cardano Community recognizes that it must
be remembered that this is not a constitution for only a blockchain but rather
a constitution for a blockchain ecosystem – a much more ambitious endeavor.
Accordingly, how governance actions are approved, while extremely important, is
not the sole focus of this Constitution.
Rather, this Constitution provides the basis and fundamental framework through
which all participants in the Cardano Community can come together to govern
themselves and form radically new approaches to human interaction and
collaboration.

By necessity, this Constitution recognizes the role of and empowers the
Constitutional Committee, confirms the right of the Cardano Community to
participate in collective bodies for collaboration, gives effect to on-chain
governance, and empowers DReps to act as the voice of ada owners for on-chain
voting.

The Constitution also recognizes the necessity of safeguarding access to and
the use of funds of the Cardano Blockchain treasury through the inclusion of
the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails in this Constitution.

### 2\. Other Guidance

[Permalink: 2. Other Guidance](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-constitution/blob/main/cardano-constitution-1/cardano-constitution-1.txt.md#2-other-guidance)

The drafters of the Constitution, together with other participants from the
Cardano Community, have published and in the future may publish guidance for
interpreting the Constitution, including, without limitation, a definition
booklet that has been released contemporaneously with the on-chain ratification
of the Constitution.
So long as any such published guidance has been hashed to the Cardano
Blockchain pursuant to an "Info" action, the Constitutional Committee shall not
be precluded from considering and utilizing such guidance as it deems
appropriate.

You can’t perform that action at this time.
